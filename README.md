# Software Design and Development Approach
## How do I approach designing software?
When I embark on a software design journey, I start by thoroughly understanding the project requirements and objectives. This involves extensive stakeholder discussions and requirement gathering sessions. Once the requirements are clear, I focus on designing a modular, extensible, and maintainable architecture that meets both current and future needs.

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Working on this project has honed my skills in architectural design, particularly in structuring components such as meshes, shaders, and rendering pipelines. Additionally, I've gained expertise in designing for performance and scalability, ensuring efficient rendering algorithms and data structures.

## What design process did you follow for your project work?
My design process involved iterative development, starting with high-level architectural design and gradually refining the design based on implementation feedback and testing. I followed principles of object-oriented design, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, to create reusable and maintainable components.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The design tactics employed in this project can be applied to future projects across various domains. Emphasizing modularity and abstraction facilitates the creation of robust and flexible software systems in any domain. Furthermore, the experience gained in optimizing performance and managing complex dependencies is valuable in projects with stringent performance requirements.

# Program Development Strategies
## How do I approach developing programs?
When developing programs, I follow a systematic process that includes requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. Agile methodologies like Scrum or Kanban facilitate iterative development and adaptation to changing requirements.

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
In the context of 3D scene development, I employed strategies for optimizing rendering performance, such as using efficient data structures (e.g., vertex buffers), minimizing redundant state changes, and leveraging GPU parallelism. I also utilized design patterns specific to graphics programming, such as the factory pattern for creating mesh objects.

## How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration played a crucial role in the development process, allowing me to incrementally improve the implementation based on feedback and testing results. Each iteration involved adding new features, optimizing performance, fixing bugs, and refining the user experience.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach to code development evolved from initial exploration and experimentation to a more structured and systematic process as the project progressed. I transitioned from rapid prototyping to disciplined practices like code reviews, unit testing, and continuous integration to ensure code quality and reliability.

#Benefits of Computer Science and Computational Graphics
## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides a solid foundation of knowledge and skills that empower me to tackle complex problems, innovate solutions, and pursue various career paths in technology. It equips me with analytical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and a deep understanding of algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational and professional pathways?
Computational graphics and visualizations expose me to concepts and techniques related to rendering, modeling, animation, and simulation, applicable across diverse fields such as computer-aided design, virtual reality, gaming, scientific visualization, and data analysis. These skills enrich my educational experience by providing hands-on experience with real-world applications and enhancing my ability to communicate complex ideas effectively. In my professional pathway, skills in computational graphics and visualizations open doors to careers in areas such as computer graphics programming, game development, UX/UI design, data visualization, simulation engineering, and scientific computing, offering diverse opportunities for growth and innovation.
